Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of a P4 computer, with the turbo C , making it print "Hello, Jawad" for the very first time. As I went through the BASIC tutorial, it was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing in these funny little symbols, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity. Throughout my College life, I latched on to any ideas for projects I could get, moving from "Hello World", I learned C, then C++, tearing through any books I could find on anything remotely related to software development. I was insatiable.

This passion carried me through my Degree Of Software Engineering at Gc University. Here there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I studied new languages, Algorithms, Data Structure, SDLC, Software Project management, Software Design and Architecture, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. And it was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.

So, now, in practical life, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful
