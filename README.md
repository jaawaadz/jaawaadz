## I'm Ahmad Jawad
### Software Engineer
![Android Development](https://github.com/jaawaadz/jaawaadz/blob/main/20221208_160422.jpg)

Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of a P4 computer, with the turbo C , making it print "Hello, Jawad" for the very first time. As I went through the BASIC tutorial, it was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing in these funny little symbols, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity. Throughout my College life, I latched on to any ideas for projects I could get, moving from "Hello World", I learned C, then C++, tearing through any books I could find on anything remotely related to software development. I was insatiable.

This passion carried me through my Degree Of Software Engineering at Gc University. Here there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I studied new languages, Algorithms, Data Structure, SDLC, Software Project management, Software Design and Architecture, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. And it was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.

So, now, in practical life, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful

## ConsoliAds Mediation And Ads Network SDK

It‚Äôs an Ad marketplace SDK for game and App Publishers to enable their Apps for Ad serving. I deal
with Stats counts, Devices Analytics for GMS and HMS both, API Calls for the Server and provide the required data to the server for Campaign Management like OS Version, RAM, Device Model etc. I use Volley custom Request mechanism to make this achievable. Create Model and Architecture for this Process.
In mediation we have a waterfall mechanism, if one AdNetwork fail to
Provide the Ad then we Request the Other Ad network, I work on it with Team. My contribution is to put them on maven Solve the Crashes by Analyzing the Publish APK, remove the Memory Leaks and Handle the Thread Process.
